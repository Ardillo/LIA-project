# LIA-project

This proof of concept code is part of a project for the course on Large Installation Administration (LIA) in the System and Network Engineering (SNE) Master of the University of Amsterdam. 

Hardware inventorization using Intel AMT.

This proof-of-concept relies heavily on the Meshcommander project, which can be found 
at the [Meshcommander](http://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander) website.

All the credits need to go to [Ylian Saint-Hilaire](https://software.intel.com/en-us/user/337009) for developing this awesome project.

One of the samples is adjusted to display only some hardware classes in order to demonstrate the use of Intel AMT in doing hardware inventorization. The meaning of the fields and the classes can be found back in the references of Intel,
[Intel AMT WS-man Class Reference](https://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide/WordDocuments/wsmanagementclassreference.htm).

In order to use this proof of concept you need the NW.js (node-webkit) from [nwjs.io](http://nwjs.io/).
